# Corporate Management System - Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide for Testing the Backend API

### 1. **Setup and Run the Application**

```powershell
# Navigate to the project directory
cd "c:\Users\MuBeeN\Downloads\CorporateManagementSystem_Backend_With_Auth\CorporateManagementSystem"

# Make sure database is updated with latest migrations
dotnet ef database update --project CMS.Infrastructure --startup-project CMS.API

### 8. **Common Test Scenarios**

**Employee Onboarding Flow:**
1. Create new department (if needed)
2. Create/sync new user from external system
3. Request assets for new employee
4. Approve asset requests
5. Assign assets to employee

**Expense Management Flow:**
1. Employee submits expense
2. Manager reviews and approves/rejects
3. Finance processes approved expenses
4. Generate expense reports

**Asset Lifecycle Flow:**
1. Purchase new asset (create asset record)
2. Assign to employee
3. Schedule maintenance
4. Update asset condition
5. Retire when no longer useful
